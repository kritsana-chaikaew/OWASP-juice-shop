# OWASP-juice-shop
Let's play it!

I open http://localhost:3000, it is a web site about juice so that it's called juice shop. I have no idea how to play it LOL.

It looks like I have to login, but not sure it play online or offline?

I tried to login with 'or'1'='1 but not work...but! when I used ' in username box, it's show errors!

Got it! I tried username ' or 'a' = 'a' -- and it work -- is comment is sql.

It say "You successfully solved a challenge: Error Handling (Provoke an error that is not very gracefully handled.)" I think
it's about trying ' in username box and "You successfully solved a challenge: Login Admin (Log in with the administrator's user account.)" for bypass login.

I haven't found the instruction yet. I thought I need to find all URLs.

Luckly, I found a comment about link to scoreboard in the source code.

As I thought, a scoreboard page contains all problem that I have to solve.
